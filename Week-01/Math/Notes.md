# Week 01 – Math Notes
**Topic:** Arithmetic Refresh; Variables & Expressions  

---

## 📖 1. Key Concepts
- [ ] Numbers & operations  
- [ ] Order of operations (PEMDAS)  
- [ ] Variables and algebraic expressions  
- [ ] Properties (commutative, associative, distributive)  

---

## 🧮 2. Formulas & Rules
- Addition: `a + b = b + a`  
- Multiplication: `a × b = b × a`  
- Distributive: `a × (b + c) = ab + ac`  
- Operator precedence: `() → ^ → ×/÷ → +/−`  

---

## ✍️ 3. Examples
**Example 1:** Simplify `3 + 5 × 2`  
👉 Solution: `3 + 10 = 13`  

**Example 2:** If `x = 4`, evaluate `2x + 3`  
👉 Solution: `2(4) + 3 = 11`

## 📝 4. Common Mistakes
- Forgetting order of operations.  
- Mixing multiplication & exponent rules.  
- Using `=` incorrectly (assignment vs equality).  

---

## 🔗 5. Practice Problems (to solve later)
1. Simplify `10 − 2 × 3`  
2. If `y = 5`, find value of `3y² + 2y − 1`.  
3. Expand: `2(a + b) + 3a`.  

---

## 🎯 6. Takeaways
- Always follow PEMDAS for clarity.  
- Expressions are **rules**, not just numbers.  
- Variables help generalize problems.
