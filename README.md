# Systematic Mastery

**Continuous mastery through structured weekly learning and real-world projects.**

This repository is my structured **104-week learning journey** â€” a blend of theory, practice, and projects â€” aimed at achieving depth in **mathematics, data structures & algorithms (DSA), programming (JavaScript), and software engineering fundamentals**.  

Itâ€™s not just about notes â€” every week has **clear goals, practice problems, and a hands-on project**.
